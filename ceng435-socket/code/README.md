IMPORTANT NOTE:
In our implementation we assumed that the client is the sender and the server is the receiver. I hope it wonâ€™t be problem for your tests. After a long time in the project we realized that The object will transfer from server to client. We are sorry for the confusion. In our setup we send the objects from client to server.
